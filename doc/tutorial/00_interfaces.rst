Interfaces
----------

LASIF defines a project via its directory structure. LASIF currently only
supports one interface to interact with. That is directly through the
command line interface. LASIF used to have a web interface but that is
currently not supported. The web interface is a potential feature that
might be added in the future.


API
===

The recommended way to interact with LASIF is via the API interface.
It allows for an easy way of chaining a few LASIF commands together through
a Python script. The API documentation can be found here: :doc:`../api_doc`


Command Line Interface
======================

Another way to interact with LASIF is through the command line interface. 
Please read the introduction to the :doc:`../cli` before proceeding.
