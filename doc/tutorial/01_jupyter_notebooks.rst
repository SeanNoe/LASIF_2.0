Jupyter Notebooks
----------------------

A repository of LASIF tutorials can be found in this 
`repository <https://github.com/solvithrastar/LASIF_tutorials>`_.

Currently there is only one tutorial in there of using LASIF with Salvus but 
the tutorial translates to other solvers to a large extent. An extra tutorial 
for using another solver will appear at a later time.
