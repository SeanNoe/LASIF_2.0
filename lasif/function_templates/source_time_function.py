Project specific source time function.

Only relevant when SES3D is used as a solver as SPECFEM always uses a
delta-like source time function.

    Optional source time function that can be used with Salvus

    Do whatever you wish in here but make sure it returns an array of
    ``npts`` samples. Furthermore the spectral content of source time
    function + processing of synthetics should equal the spectral content of
    the processed data. Otherwise the seismograms cannot readily be compared.

    The first sample in the resulting source time function also has to be zero!

    Freqmin and freqmax specify the bandpass filter frequencies.
