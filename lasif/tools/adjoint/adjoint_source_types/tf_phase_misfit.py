DESCRIPTION = r"""
Time Frequency Phase Misfit is modelled after Fichtner et al. 2008. It measures
a misfit in phase between synthetic seismograms (:math: `u_i`) and recorded 
seismograms (:math: `u^0_i`). It is based on the time-frequency transform of 
both data and synthetics. The phase misfit is defined by:

.. math::

    E^n_p(u^0_i, u_i) := \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}W^n_p(t,\omega)[\phi_i(t,\omega)
    -\phi^0_i(t,\omega)]^n dtd\omega

Which is then used to define the adjoint source for displacement seismograms:

.. math::

    f^{\dagger}(\tau) = E^{1-n}_{p}\Im \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} W^n_p(t,\omega)
    [\phi_i(t,\omega) - phi^0_i(t,\omega)]^(n-1)[\frac{\hat{u}_i(t,\omega)}
    {\left \hat{u}_i(t,\omega) \right ^2}h(\tau - t)eË†{\mathbf{i}\omega\tau}]dt
    d\omega

Where :math: `h(\tau - t)` is a sliding window function (e.g. a gaussian).
An advantage of the time frequency phase misfit over the cross correlation time
shift (which also measures phase/time shift) is that this gives a measurement
of misfit as a function of time and frequency while the cross correlation only
gives a single valued estimate for each window.

For a more detailed description, we refer to Fichtner et al. 2008.
